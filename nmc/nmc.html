                <p>After exploring some awesome opportunities through the student organizations that I was in, where I started doing graphic design and learned how to use various creative software, I realized that I wanted to learn more about the different technology that were used and perhaps more. In researching about other programs that was available at UGA, I found out about the New Media certificate program and signed up for my first class by Fall of 2019. Through my journey, I was able learn valuable insignts and skills for UI/UX and web design through the classes offered. I gained experience in working with HTML/CSS, WordPress, and JavaScript through the New Media Production class, conducting usability tests through the User Experience Strategy class, and even brand ideation and graphic design skills through the New Media Design class.</p>

                            <p>I had my first introduction to HTML/CSS, WordPress, and JavaScript through New Media Production. Never have I thought that I would be able to create an entire webpage from scratch. Although my very first website was not the ideal aesthetic I would typically want, I was extremely proud at the fact that I learned and had personally coded the page. We then learned how to use Bootstrap to code our websites for project 2 (where we created three webpages to learn how using bootstrap and templates might minimize the time it takes to create a working website). We also explore WordPress in Project 3 where we were able to create a news site and a commerce site using WordPress. Personally, I had a difficult time working with WordPress as I couldn't fully visualize the website I wanted to create. For my fourth project in the class, we got to learn basic JavaScript through a series of challenges. This was definitely the hardest of all the projects but was very fulfilling once I had completed the challenges. I'm glad I was able to learn these valuable skills through the class and had led me to become more interested in website design.</p>

                            <p>As part of the final class of the New Media Certificate program, I had the chance to work with a group of amazing individuals to create and deploy an IOS app, Flexlist. Our group's original goal was to create a widget. However, after considering our limitations, we pivoted onto a new idea to create an task tracking app. As part of the project, we designed the app, created a visual style guide, built the app, and even created our own trailer to promote the app. Despite encountering numerous obstacles as we worked on the project, with the help of our team members and instructors, we were able to complete and showcase the app at the NMIXpo, a biannual event held at the end of every semesters.</p>

                            <p>Through this class, I was able to learn more about usability and accessibility of design. I was also able to practice implementing the things I learned through various assignments and projects. Throughout the class, we did design drills like redesigning a button, designing  404 message page, creating a wireframe. These assignments had opened my eyes to understanding how important assessible designs are. For our group project, my group had chose to study Athena, a UGA portal used for class registration, financial aid, and etc... Along with my group members, we were able to research, perform audience analysis, and create personas. We then proceed to develop a survey and held a simmulation/usability tests to help identify issues users were experiencing while visiting the page. Based on the results, we were able to come up with some suggestions as to how we can improve the website so that people can navigate around the portal more easily.</p>

                            <p>Prior to beginning the class, I had gradually felt a growing interest in graphic designs due to the work I had done through the UGA VSA Marketing Committee for Night in Saigon. However, I had very little experience in using Adobe programs at the time. Throughout the course of this class, I had the opportunity to explore programs like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Sparks, XD as I worked on the different assignments for the class. For one of our earlier project in the class, I was able to work with a group partner (client) to design a website, logo, and even create style guide. This was extremely fun and interesting to learn as I did not know what it took for to create a brand. For the final group project, my group created a fictional brand, Headliner, which is a streaming service for musicals, concerts, and festivals. Through this project, we worked together to develop personas, logos, style guide, website design, supporting app design, and even promotional contents for the service. I thought this was a really cool and one-of-a-kind project that I have done so far at UGA. I believe I definitely learned a lot from it, from learning how to work effectively in a group (especially virtually) to gaining a better understanding of how to use the Adobe programs to develop the deliverables.</p>

                            <p>While the topic in this class was something I was initially afraid of exploring, I am really glad to have had the opportunity to take this class. Through this class, we learned to use Xcode and Swift to build IOS native applications. As I have grew up mostly surrounded by Windows-based products, learning how to create apps for IOS was definitely a learning curve. Throughout the class, we learned how to code different elements for an app, like buttons, lists, animations. For our midterm and final project, we even got to create a more in-dept app that utilized multiple elements that we had previous learned. For these projects, I decided to create a travel itinerary app that allows you to view your daily plans while traveling. I definitely learned a lot from this class and hope that I can conttinue to learn more about the topic in the future. Following this class, it would be interesting to see how I could potentially go from designing a wireframe for an app to making that design a reality similar to how I could design a website using Adobe XD to use HTML/CSS to code it.</p>
