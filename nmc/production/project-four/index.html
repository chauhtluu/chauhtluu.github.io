                <p>For the first challenge, I worked learn how to create a Drum Kit using JavaScript. I chose to do this challenge as I felt that the end result of it would be much more interactive than the other challenges but also because of how interesting the process seemed to be. The process was somewhat tedious as sometimes the code didn't quite work which meant I would have to go over all the code to find my mistake. However, the more time I spend working on the Drum Kit, the more fascinating I found the project. During the course of this challenge, I definitely relied on the instruction video and the finished JS file a lot in order to check my work as I go along. <br> I changed the color that was applied to the key when clicked on. Learning how to add a navigation bar was quite tricky as I needed to make sure the navigation bar was aligned well, relative to the rest of the components on the page. I am very proud of how the page turned out to be, especially the background as well as overall color scheme that the page has. I found the Drum Kit itself to be very fun to try out as well! I definitely believe that it be great if I could explore JavaScript more in the future in order to create better tools/games.</p>

                <p>As part of the second challenge, I attempted the Flex Panels challenge. I found this challenge to be very interesting and somethinng I would love to know how to do for future works/projects. I believe that this was one of the challenge that I struggled with the most. While adding my own images and content was not necessarily difficult, the JavaScript and CSS portion was something I definitely had struggle with. For the most part, I experienced difficulty in making the code work as the panels would not expand when I click on them. However, after doing multiple recoding and check, the flex panels ended up working as it was intended to. I also encountered some obstacles in working with the navigation bar and h1 element. Due to the nature/layout of the page, adding in a navigation bar made the page look quite odd, but I was able to use CSS to modify the look of the bar. I really like how the end result appears, and I think that the different elements work together very well. Similarly, I tried my best to match the fonts, color scheme, and overall aesthetics across the different pages.</p>

            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>Out of all the challenges that I have attempted for project four, I had the most struggle completing this challenge. I thought the interface that this challenge had looked very nice and wanted to add my own modification such as video and background. As the original starting code included a video link, I wanted to change the link to a different video. In project two, I had used the iframe method to embed the video, however, for this challenge, I was unable to do so and resorted to finding a download file for the video that I wanted to use in order for it to play on the page. Another obstacle that I had encountered in this challenge is formating the navigation bar as well as the heading and paragraph element. Although I planned to have the navigation bar and heading element displayed up top like in challenge 2, I was unable to do so despite trying out all the different ways I could think of. As a result, I chose to have the navigation bar and page heading reside beside the video player and scrubber. However, I was really proud of how the page look and how well the color scheme match with the other pages.</p>
